# freqtrade-ftx-future-3commas
Enables FTX Futures trading using freqtrade on 3commas. For both standalone and docker installations. 

If you just want to use FTX futures within freqtrade, you only need to perform step 1. This will mean freqtrade manages the buy/sell signals as it normmally would.  

## Do NOT use unless you understand what you're doing and you enjoy losing money. 

These modified files allow you to use FTX PERP futures pairs from within a freqtrade bot, passing the buy signal to 3commas to enable auto DCA'ing. This has been confirmed working with freqtrade 2021.11. There may be unintended and unantcipated consequences to these modified files. DCA can be risky, this risk is magnified with leveraged futures. If you do use this; only trade what you can afford to lose. This was confirmed working stable 2021.11. Later versions may break functionality without warning.

### Prerequisites
> Working freqtrade installation
> 
> A FTX account with enough USD/USDT in your wallet to trade futures. 

## Installation

### 1. Enabling FTX Future within freqtrade

#### Stand alone installation (recommended)

Copy `exchange.py` and `ftx.py` to the `./freqtrade/exchange/` directory; overwriting the existing files.

Copy `IPairList.py` to the `./freqtrade/plugins/pairlist/` directory; overwriting the existing file.

Edit your existing `config.json` file. Set your `"stake_currency"` to `USD`. We need to filter to only enable PERP futures pairlists and filter the other USD spot market pairs. To do this add `".*/USD"` to your pairs blacklist and `".*PERP/.*"` to your whitelist.  If you wish to avoid trading non perpetual futures include `".*-([0123456789])+",` in your blacklist (thanks to stash on the freqtrade discord). See the example config. Make sure you've set your exchange to `ftx` (don't need to have keys in the config, we'll be running freqtrade as a dry run.

#### Docker installation (alternative)

We will need to overwrite the `exchange.py, ftx.py and IPairList.py` within the docker image. You can't simply copy and paste them into a directory. You must use the supplied `docker-compose.yml` and `dockerfile.custom` enable docker to copy the modified files into the docker image. If this fails, check the `dockerfile.custom` path to make sure you've set the right source directory for it to find the files to copy. If your strat uses some python packages that are outside of the default; make sure they're included to be installed in the `dockerfile.custom`.

### 2. Setting up freqtrade to send trades to 3commas

Please follow the excellent documentation at https://github.com/AlexBabescu/freqtrade_3commas. Make sure you've created your bot as a multi-pair/long only bot, configured freqtrade within config.json and downloaded and installed the wrapper in the correct directory. 

Once you have `freqtrade3cw.py` in your `user_data` folder; we need to do some modifications to enable freqtrade to send the right buy command to 3commas due to the way FTX names its pairs

From within `freqtrade3cw.py` we need to change:
```
coin, currency = metadata['pair'].split('/')
```
to:
```
coin = metadata['pair']
```

We then also need to change:
```
"pair": f"{currency}_{coin}",
```
to:
```
"pair": f"USD_{coin}",
```

### 3. Start trading

Make sure you've imported `Freqtrade3cw` into your strategy and decorated the `populate_buy_trend` method (as described in the wrapper setup). Start freqtrade as you normally would (in a dry run) and keep an eye on 3commas as the signals come in. You can choose which specific futures pairs you want to trade from within freqtrade as you normally (Volume list etc) or can manually set a static pairlist from within `config.json` depending on your preference.
