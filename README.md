# freqtrade-ftx-future-3commas
Enables FTX Futures trading using freqtrade on 3commas

## Do NOT use live unless you understand what you're doing and you enjoy losing money. 

These modified files allow you to use FTX PERP futures pairs from within a freqtrade, passing the buy signal to 3commas to enable auto DCA'ing. This has been confirmed working with freqtrade 2021.11. There may be unintended and unantcipated consequences to these modified files. DCA can be risky, this risk is magnified with leveraged futures. If you do use this; only trade what you can afford to lose.
